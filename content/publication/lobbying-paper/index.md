abstract: "This paper studies the role of intermediaries in the allocation of political access. Using novel data on lobbying contacts between clients, lobbying firms, and lawmakers in New York State, I document three key empirical facts: (i) legislative influence, committee assignment, and seniority are strong predictors of contact volume; (ii) commercial lobbyists are significantly more active than in-house lobbyists, particularly when connected to lawmakers via campaign contributions or prior employment; and (iii) connections are used selectively, even after conditioning on issue-area alignment and agent identities. Building on these facts, I propose a model in which lobbying firms and clients negotiate fees as a function of firm-specific characteristics and expected returns. The model embeds a matching mechanism that allocates contacts to lawmakers in a manner that maximizes client welfare subject to two equilibrium constraints: a market-clearing condition equating supply and demand for contacts, and a participation condition linking lobbying effort to negotiated fees. The framework rationalizes observed contact patterns and provides a foundation for estimating counterfactual allocations under alternative intermediation structures."
